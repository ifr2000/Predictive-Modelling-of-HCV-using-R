# Predictive Modeling of HCV Categories using R: Exploring Feature Importance and Model Performance

## Abstract

The high incidence of Hepatitis C (HCV) and potential long-term health effects make research into the disease of utmost relevance. To stop future transmission and provide timely treatment measures, early detection and diagnosis of HCV infection are essential. With a focus on determining the distribution of various Hepatitis C stages and developing precise models to pinpoint those at a higher risk of HCV infection based on known factors, this study intends to investigate the predictive modeling of HCV categories using the R programming language.
To accomplish this goal, data will be analyzed using statistical models and methods, and the links between numerous parameters connected to HCV infection will be investigated. The study will investigate the relevance of feature importance in foretelling the various phases of hepatitis C, offering insights into the major factors that affect the risk and development of the illness. Additionally, the effectiveness of the prediction models will be assessed in order to determine their precision and dependability in identifying people who are more likely to contract HCV.
This study has a variety of advantages. First off, by examining the distribution of different HCV phases, we may better understand how the disease develops and pinpoint crucial times for therapy and intervention. Chronic liver disease and its effects can be greatly diminished with early HCV infection identification. Second, by creating precise predictive models, healthcare providers can proactively identify those who are more likely to contract HCV, allowing for more focused screening and prevention methods. By concentrating efforts on those who are most vulnerable to HCV infection, this research can help to improve healthcare outcomes and resource allocation.
In conclusion, this study attempts to increase our knowledge of HCV infection and its distribution across several stages by utilizing statistical modeling and predictive methodologies. This work has the potential to enhance early detection, intervention, and prevention measures, resulting in better health outcomes for people with hepatitis C. This is accomplished by identifying significant traits and developing precise predictive models.

## Introduction

With millions of victims worldwide, the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes a huge global health burden. The negative effects of HCV must be minimized through early detection and treatment. The analysis of our HCV dataset is the main goal of this research study, which focuses on using predictive modeling methods. In order to estimate the disease stage (Category) based on these variables, the dataset includes the clinical and laboratory test results of 615 individuals who have been diagnosed with HCV in which there are individuals that consist of Anti-HCV Antibodies. Through statistical and predictive modelling, we were able to answer these three research questions:
a.) What is the distribution of liver-related clinical outcomes (such as Hepatitis C, Cirrhosis, Fibrosis) among individuals with HCV infection in the dataset?
b.) Can we build predictive models to identify individuals at a higher risk of HCV infection based on the available variables? How accurate is the model in predicting HCV infection and which is the best performing one?
c.) Does the gender (male and female) have a statistically significant relationship with the occurrence of Hepatitis C?
The initial goal of this study is to look at the distribution of clinical outcomes linked to the liver, including cirrhosis, fibrosis, and hepatitis C, among those with HCV infection in the dataset. Understanding the prevalence and distribution of various disease stages can provide important insights into the development and severity of HCV. Healthcare practitioners and politicians can use this information to build focused intervention strategies and allocate resources more efficiently. The second goal is to create a predictive model that, using the information at hand, can pinpoint people who are more likely to contract HCV. The model seeks to properly predict the chance of HCV infection by examining numerous clinical and laboratory parameters, such as age, gender, serum albumin level, liver enzyme levels, and others. Our third goal is to statistically observe if the “Gender” (Male and Female) are holding any significance on relation with Hepatitis C.
The findings of this study have the potential to increase patient outcomes, direct future research, and advance public health activities in the area of HCV infection. They may also improve HCV management practices.

## Data Source and Methodology

The HCV dataset from the UCI machine learning repository was the one used in this research study. The dataset includes information on the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of HCV-infected patients. The dataset consists of 615 HCV-positive patients and 13 characteristics.
The multinomial logistic Classification model, the random forest, and the KNN classification are the statistical models employed in this research paper. Based on the features found in the dataset, these models are helpful in predicting the types of HCV. Random forest creates a final prediction by combining several different decision trees. It can handle categorical and continuous variables and can offer a measure of feature relevance, allowing us to pinpoint the most crucial traits for predicting HCV groups. This makes it beneficial in this situation. Several categorical variables' associations are shown through multinomial logistic Classification because it can handle several categories and give a gauge of the degree of correlation between the predictor factors and the response variable, it is helpful in this situation. A non-parametric method for classification and prediction tasks is KNN classification. The fact that it can handle categorical and continuous variables, as well as provide a measure of similarity across various observations, makes it valuable in this situation because it enables us to determine which patients are the most similar based on the features found in the dataset. These models were chosen because they can handle categorical and continuous variables, quantify the significance and relationship of characteristics, and can recognize patients who are similar based on attributes found in the dataset.

## Analysis and Results

Basic Understanding of the dataset via Visualization and Summary Statistics.
When we display the correlation plot of the dataset, we see that there are not many important or strong correlation between the predictors.
The only visible relation we can see that is prominent is between the GGT and AST levels in the dataset. Which means that multicollinearity is not present in the dataset.
In our dataset, we see that the category for Blood Donors which is 0 are the observations that are present in huge quantity compared to the positive disease stages. Whereas, from the age distribution graph we can see that the average age range of the patients in the dataset lies around 45 – 50 years.
One of the research questions that we are interested in answering is whether there are any difference with predictions based on gender while predicting the risk of hepatitis in Individuals.
Understanding the gender distribution in the dataset for the former reason is very crucial. We can see that there are more male patients in the dataset than female patients in the dataset. Also based on the correlation plot we can see that the AST vs CHOL graph is a sample relation graph to affirm that the highest correlation in the dataset among predictors isn’t strong which is what we observe from the above infographic.
Multinomial Logistic Classification for Category Variable:
In this study, a multinomial logistic Classification model was fitted to investigate and forecast the hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis disease stage categories among patients with HCV diagnoses. A dataset of 615 patients' clinical and laboratory test results was used by the model. The investigation sought to comprehend the association between several predictor variables, including age, gender, the patient's disease stage, and the blood type.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the study of the HCV dataset yielded important knowledge about the aspects of Hepatitis C. To comprehend the prevalence of the disease and its associations with various factors, a few predictive models were used, including random forest, KNN, and multinomial logistic regression. With an AUC of 0.961, the random forest model performed the best, demonstrating its superiority in the prediction of hepatitis C. The investigation also looked at the importance of gender in relation to hepatitis C, emphasizing how it can affect the condition. Future research should concentrate on overcoming these constraints by utilizing larger and more varied datasets, including extra variables, and applying advanced modeling techniques to further increase our understanding of Hepatitis C.
